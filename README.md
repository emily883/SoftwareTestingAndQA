## Reflection on the Work Done

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure the functionality and security of my code, I employ various strategies. First, I implement **unit tests** to identify errors early in the development process and ensure that each component functions as expected. I also follow secure development practices, such as **input validation** and proper access control. Lastly, I use automation tools to perform repetitive tests and verify system integrity after every change.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs, I first analyze the **requirements** provided by the client or end-user. This includes identifying critical features and common use cases. I conduct **stakeholder meetings** and review requirements to clarify any uncertainties. During development, I align the software design with these needs and perform tests to ensure the outcome meets user expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design starts with creating a **clear and modular architecture** to make the program easier to understand, maintain, and extend in the future. I use flowcharts and other visual tools to plan the systemâ€™s flow. I also apply object-oriented design principles, such as **encapsulation and single responsibility**, to keep the code clean and maintainable. The design always focuses on meeting project requirements and minimizing potential errors through continuous testing.
